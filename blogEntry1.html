                        <h3>Why I Googled "animal"</h3>
                        <p>
                            The most momentous occasion of my life has just occurred. Before I tell you the story of googling the word "animal", 
                            let me give you some backstory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided I wanted to make a website to try out web development more. I debated long and hard about what type of site to build,
                            and I finally decided to make a personal portfolio and blog. After I started development, I realized I wanted 
                            to have pictures for the blog and other parts of the site. 
                            Not planning on writing the blogs right then and there, I obviously needed to get mock/filler pictures. 
                            Do I get random pictures? Do I get pictures of myself? Do I google images? What term would I google?
                            It's pretty hard to find "random" pictures when you have to think about how to acquire a random picture.
                            It felt weird using selfies because then I'd have to stare at my face for hours while making the site.
                            Torn about what to do, I started scrolling through my camera roll and I came across my cat album. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ever since quarantine, I've really liked looking at cats on the internet because they're derpy and always behave questionably.
                            I then made the genius connection that cats are animals. Naturally, my mind went to searching for animal pictures to use as 
                            the filler pictures. This was the most amazing idea of my lifetime. No one has ever used animal pictures before. Ever.
                            So, I googled the word "animal". After just two scrolling motions of my pointer finger, I found the jackpot - the perfect photo.
                            I felt an indescribable wave as I looked at the photo above.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
                        <p>
                            After finding the photo, I went back to making my site. I know what you're thinking, and yea, what a thriller this story is.
                            I actually think I missed a few steps. I right clicked the photo, clicked "save", saved it to my laptop, and bam.
                            When it was finally time to use this picture for the blog page, I realized that I needed some filler words as well.
                            See, I could just go to Lorem Ipsum for dummy text, but that's too easy... time to write about absolutely nothing.
