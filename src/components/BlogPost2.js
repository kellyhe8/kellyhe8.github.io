            I've never really been a huge animal person. Don't get me wrong, I
            think animals are cool and all, but I never really had pets growing
            up, meaning I've never had the pet bond with any animal before, and
            so animals didn't cross my mind as much. Around March, I just
            started really liking cats all of a sudden. I really don't know why.
            It'd probably been building up for a few months prior - I think it
            could've had something to do with the fact that I went to Italy in
            January and stayed with a family who had 3 really soft and cute
            cats. But anyway, then when we got kicked off campus and had to
            quarantine for 5 months (and counting. it's actually been exactly 5
            months today! ðŸ˜®), and so I guess I'm now like a cat lady without
            any cats. An internet cat lady. An e-cat lady.

                  animals, you will find an overwhelming number of cat pictures
                  because they're the best.

                  This one just showed up on my feed one day and it has some
                  pretty quality content, emphasis on the some. The content is
                  super varied, which is good, but that means some videos are
                  bad and some are good. What exactly defines a good cat video
                  vs. a bad vat video? Well that's a topic for another blog
                  post.

                  I just looked up "cats" on instagram and this showed up. It
                  has 11.6 million followers at this point, so I'm at least
                  someone would recommend them. After scanning their page pretty
                  quickly, I think their videos are more on the cute side rather
                  than derpy or funny cat side. I personally like the derp, but
                  I definitely see the appeal of the cute.

                  So this one also came up when I searched "cats" on instagram,
                  but it seems to have more of the derp vibe that I talked about
                  in the last point. It has 1.1 million followers which is
                  nothing to scoff at, but significantly less than
                  @cats_of_instagram! After looking at their page for a bit,
                  they're definitely catering towards those who like cat memes
                  other funny cat media. Definitely up my alley.
