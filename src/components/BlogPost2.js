          I've never really been a huge animal person. Don't get me wrong, I
          think animals are cool and awesome, but I never really had pets and so
          I've never had the pet bond with any animal before, and so animals
          didn't cross my mind as much. Around march, I just started really
          liking cats all of a sudden. I really don't know why. It'd probably
          been building up for a few months prior - I'm thinking it could've
          been because I went to Italy and stayed with a family who had 3 cats
          in January. But anyway, then when we got kicked off campus and had to
          quarantine for 5 months (and counting. it's actually been exactly 5
          months today! ðŸ˜®), and so I guess I'm an cat lady without any cats. An
          internet cat lady. An e-cat lady.

                Even though this is "A subreddit for cute and cuddly pictures",
                implying that it's a space for all cute and cuddly animals, you
                will find an overwhelming number if cat pictures because they're
                the best.

                This one just showed up on my feed one day and it has some
                pretty quality content, emphasis on the some. The content is
                super varied, which is good, but that means some videos are bad
                and some are good. What exactly defines a good cat video vs. a
                bad vat video? Well that's a topic for another blog post.

                I just looked up "cats" on instagram and this showed up. It has
                11.6 million followers at this point, so I'm at least someone
                would recommend them. After scanning their page pretty quickly,
                I think their videos are more on the cute side rather than derpy
                or funny cat side. I personally like the derp, but I definitely
                see the appeal of the cute.

                So this one also came up when I searched "cats" on instagram,
                but it seems to have more of the derp vibe that I talked about
                in the last point. It has 1.1 million followers which is nothing
                to scoff at, but significantly less than @cats_of_instagram!
                After looking at their page for a bit, they're definitely
                catering towards those who like cat memes other funny cat media.
                Definitely up my alley.
