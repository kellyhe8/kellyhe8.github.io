It has\n                11.6 million followers at this point, so I'm at least someone\n                would recommend them. After scanning their page pretty quickly,\n                I think their videos are more on the cute side rather than derpy\n                or funny cat side. I personally like the derp, but I definitely\n                see the appeal of the cute.\n              </Typography>\n            </ListItem>\n            <ListItem divider>\n              <Link\n                href=\"https://www.instagram.com/catsdoingthings\"\n                variant=\"body1\"\n                className={classes.listLink}\n              >\n                @catsdoingthings on instagram\n              </Link>\n              <Typography variant=\"body1\" className={classes.listBody}>\n                So this one also came up when I searched \"cats\" on instagram,\n                but it seems to have more of the derp vibe that I talked about\n                in the last point. It has 1.1 million followers which is nothing\n                to scoff at, but significantly less than @cats_of_instagram!\n                After looking at their page for a bit, they're definitely\n                catering towards those who like cat memes other funny cat media.\n                Definitely up my alley.\n              </Typography>\n            </ListItem>\n          </List>\n        </Typography>\n\n        <Typography variant=\"h6\" className={classes.signature}>\n          Cheerio, <br />\n          Kelly\n        </Typography>\n      </Box>\n      <Contact />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default withStyles(styles)(BlogPost2);\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
