                        <h3>When I Started Liking Cats</h3>
                        <p>
                            4/1/20. I've never really been a huge animal person. Don't get me wrong, I think animals are precious and awesome, but 
                            I think it's because I never really had pets and so I just never had the experience being so close to animals. Around that time though,
                            I just started really liking cats all of a sudden. I really don't know why. It'd probably been building up for a few months prior, and 
                            then when we got kicked off campus and had to quarantine for 5 months, and so I guess I'm a cat lady without any pet cats now.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                        <p>
                            These are some thoughts about cat social media accounts:
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/">aww subreddit</a> - Even though this is "A subreddit for cute and cuddly pictures",
                                implying that it's a space for all cute and cuddly animals, you will find an overwhelming number if cat pictures because they're the best.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pleasantcats/">@pleasantcats on instagram</a> - This one just showed up on my feed one day and it has some pretty
                                quality content, emphasis on the some. The content is super varied, which is good, but that means some videos are bad and some are good.
                                What exactly defines a good cat video vs. a bad vat video? Well that's a topic for another blog post.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cats_of_instagram">@cats_of_instagram on instagram</a> - I just looked up "cats" on instagram and this showed up.
                                It has 11.6 million followers at this point, so I'm at least someone would recommend them. After scanning their page
                                pretty quickly, I think their videos are more on the cute side rather than derpy or funny cat side. I personally like the derp,
                                but I definitely see the appeal of the cute.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/catsdoingthings">@catsdoingthings on instagram</a> - So this one also came up when I searched
                                "cats" on instagram, but it seems to have more of the derp vibe that I talked about in the last point. It has 1.1 million followers
                                which is nothing to scoff at, but significantly less than @cats_of_instagram! After looking at their page for a bit, they're definitely
                                catering towards those who like cat memes other funny cat media. Definitely up my alley. 
                            </li>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I hope you check out these great cat social media pages and please recommend me some new ones. I'm pretty
                            new to the game and found those basically by chance. Let me know if I'm out of the loop.
